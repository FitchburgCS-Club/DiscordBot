#How to construct your 'config' file
The first line should be the discord bot token.

The second, optional line should be an User ID for the user
whitelisting dev feature. You can get a User ID from the discord
client by right clicking on a person's icon after enabling dev-tools
in your discord options. This feature will make the bot only respond
to you. It's perfect for testing out a dev version of the bot without
interfearing with the live version!
